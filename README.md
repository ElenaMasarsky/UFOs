# UFOs

## Overview of Project:
Dana is a data journalist. She wants to wright an article about her hometown McMinnville, Oregon. And the topic she is interested in is UFO.
JavaScript file is filled with sighting information - countries, cities, states, type of sighting. In this Project we build a table using data stored in a JavaScript array. We also create filters to make this table fully dynamic, meaning that it will react to user input, and then place the table into an HTML file for easy viewing.
We customize our webpage using Bootstrap, and equip our table with several fully functional filters that allow users to interact with our visualizations.

## Results:


## Summary:
* It doesn't make sense to have a Country filter because all sightings which database consists occured in US. Therefore, I would suggest to remove the country filter.  
* The range of dates of described events is between 1/1/2010 and 1/12/2010. That looks weird. I would suggest Dana to find more wide-ranging database.  
* And another thing I would suggest to add the search button rather than to use the Enter key to filter data.
